      p.quote "Xinmin Labs has been a driving force behind our customer facing web application. Coming on board at project launch time, Richard and the team have been instrumental in optimising our application for stability and speed. What started out as a simple support and bug hunting contract has grown into a full stack development relationship, with Xinmin labs making our new ideas and extra features become a reality. After going around the block with so many other 'rails labs', I can sincerely say that Ximni is the real deal â€“ delivering quality code on time and on budget."

They quickly produce high quality code at a reasonable price, which is well architected and easy to maintain and scale. I'd definitely use them again given the opportunity."

      p.quote "Typically product development is a trade-off between speed, quality and cost. With Xinmin Labs we had to make no such compromises. We were consistently surprised and impressed with how quickly Richard and the team could get done what they'd get done. What's more they were active contributors to improving the specifications and overall vision for our project. I look forward to working together again."
